# Uranium City History Project

This is a rebuild of the front end of the website at: http://uraniumcity-history.com

This was the second website I ever built (the first being my original portfolio) and it shows. It was built in Wordpress, which is how I cut my teeth in web development. 

I briefly thought about rebulding the entire site in whatever framework I was interested in at the time - first Laravel, then Django. But not only would this be a lot of work, it would negate all the content currently stored in the Wordpress. Particularly the comments I've received from people, either ex-residents or visitors to the town over the years - hundreds of them in total. It would be a great shame and too much work to transcribe them by hand. So Headless Wordpress to the rescue. 

I intend to update the general look of the site, brush up the UI then add a section for people to add comments and stories (and possibly photos) in real time. I'm also considering pulling in data from the 'Friends of Uranium City' FB page - hundreds of photos have been added over the years, all now the propertly of FB. Another addition will be a few data visualizations, showing things like where ex-residents live across Canada (and the world), and stats related to small towns generally. Uranium City was extreme, but its story has been replicated in one way or another in small towns across North America and the world.
